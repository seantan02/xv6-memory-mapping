Things changed oin 11/12:
1. Makefile to have task1test to test task1 implementation
2. Added syscall of wmap
3. Added content of wmap.h
4. sysproc.c impelementation of wmap should be completed

Things changed on 11/13:
1. addr checks between x600000 and x800000 in sysproc.c
2. implemented helper functions in vm.c, including removing insertWmap and creating updateWmap which basically is enough for both insert and delete
3. implemented both wmap and wunmap
4. added file_backed field to wmap.h struct
5. make changes to wmap syscall in sysproc.c to make sure addr is page aligned and legnth is > 0
6. 6 tests passed (Failed at 7th)

Things to do:
[x] Create wmap.h and add all needed declaration and enumerations
[x] Add syscall uint wmap(uint addr, int length, int flags, int fd);
[x] Create an implementation of it
[x] Now we have to figure out how to keep track of the virtual address range if it's free
[x] Implement basic wunmap without write-back
[x] Implement wmapinfo and va2pa to run tests and see if it passes some tests
[ ] Implement the file backed feature for wmap
[ ] Implement the write-back feature for wunmap
