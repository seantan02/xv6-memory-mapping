Things changed oin 11/12:
1. Makefile to have task1test to test task1 implementation
2. Added syscall of wmap
3. Added content of wmap.h
4. sysproc.c impelementation of wmap should be completed

Things to do:
[x] Create wmap.h and add all needed declaration and enumerations
[x] Add syscall uint wmap(uint addr, int length, int flags, int fd);
[x] Create an implementation of it
[x] Now we have to figure out how to keep track of the virtual address range if it's free
